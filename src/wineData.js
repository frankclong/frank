The smell was very nice and the taste even better. There was the hint of peppery taste often found in Shiraz and overall the balance was excellent. A full bodied wine. Reminded me of sunset over a field that was drying out. Huge fan - definitely got me very excited for the world of wine before me",

Attempted to uncork by screwing a screw in and pulling with hammer but wasn't too effective and I didn't want to risk anything. Eventually acquired a corkscrew to enjoy this wine. Overall, very similar to the Torbreck except lighter. Still enjoyable but definitely not as complex and forthcoming. Was not able to finish the bottle as degradation ruined it. Also the cork was damaged (side that was in the wine) and bits were falling in. Given it was almost half the price of the Torbreck, it was still a good experience and now I know Tempranillo is pretty good",
