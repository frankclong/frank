The smell was very nice and the taste even better. There was the hint of peppery taste often found in Shiraz and overall the balance was excellent. A full bodied wine. Reminded me of sunset over a field that was drying out. Huge fan - definitely got me very excited for the world of wine before me",

Attempted to uncork by screwing a screw in and pulling with hammer but wasn't too effective and I didn't want to risk anything. Eventually acquired a corkscrew to enjoy this wine. Overall, very similar to the Torbreck except lighter. Still enjoyable but definitely not as complex and forthcoming. Was not able to finish the bottle as degradation ruined it. Also the cork was damaged (side that was in the wine) and bits were falling in. Given it was almost half the price of the Torbreck, it was still a good experience and now I know Tempranillo is pretty good",

        "notes" : "Received from a family friend who no longer drinks wine. First time trying such an aged wine and I'm pretty sure this one isn't supposed to be aged. An interesting experience from the uncorking. The cork was falling apart and I tried to carefully remove it. Thankfully no chunks fell into the wine but a few crumbs did but honestly no big deal. I forgot sediment was a thing so upon pour and examining there were a lot of particles floating around. Again, didn't really affect the experience. Immediately noticed the colour was brownish. Wasn't getting much aromas from it. At this point I feared the worst and that the wine was undrinkable. Tasting it wasn't too bad though. Low body and tannins, high acidity but not too overpowering. Definitely not what I expected from a Shiraz/Cab Sauv. Overall, it wasn't bad and I will plan to finish the whole bottle but it is safe to say I will not be hunting more of these bottles",
